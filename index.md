        <h2 id="about me">About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! I'm Vuke, currently 15 years old as of 29th of October, 2021 it's currently 5:32 AM, and my birthday is in 10 day. I really like to code. Coding has, pretty much, become my side hoppy, and I really liked the idea of it so I started of learing Javascript through making bots on Discord. I also have grown a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/vukefn" target="_blank">Youtube channel</a> to 2.5k Subscribers and growing. The channel name is VukeFN.</p>

        <h2 id="why html">Why I chose HTML</h2>
            <p>Personally I have tried so many languages and I just feel like it's about time that I should try out HTML. It's the building block of almost all website, and I think it will benift me in the long run. There is this very helpful website called <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">codecademy</a>, It's the website that I learned all of the languages I know today.</p>
